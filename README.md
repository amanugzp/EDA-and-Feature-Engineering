## Projects

### Project 1: Housing Price Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of housing price datasets to identify key factors affecting property values. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

**Key Highlights:**
- Identified and handled outliers in property data
- Engineered new features based on location and property characteristics
- Created visualizations showing correlation between features and housing prices
- Developed models to predict housing prices with detailed feature importance analysis

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation
Segmentation of customer data to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing campaigns.

**Key Highlights:**
- Preprocessed customer transaction and demographic data
- Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Applied clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN) to identify customer segments
- Created visualizations to interpret and explain the identified segments

### Project 3: Time Series Analysis
Analysis of time series data to identify patterns, seasonality, and trends for forecasting.

**Key Highlights:**
- Decomposed time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
- Engineered features based on time and date information
- Developed forecasting models with evaluation metrics
- Created interactive visualizations to showcase predictions
